I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, supervised by [Prof. Jinming Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jimmyxu). Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in automation from the China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, China, in 2020. Currently, I am a visiting student with the A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Singapore, supervised by [Prof. Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/). My research interests include distributed and large-scale optimization, machine learning, and related areas such as security and privacy.
