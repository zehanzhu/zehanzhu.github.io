Hi there! I obtained my **Ph.D. degree** with the College of Control Science and Engineering, **Zhejiang University**, Hangzhou, China, supervised by [Prof. Jinming Xu](https://jinmingxu.github.io/). Previously, I received my **B.Eng. degree** in automation from the **China University of Petroleum (East China)**, Qingdao, China. I was a visiting Ph.D. student with the **A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Singapore**, supervised by [Prof. Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/). My research interests include distributed machine learning, large-scale optimization, security and privacy.
