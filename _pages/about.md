Hi there! I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Control Science and Engineering, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), Hangzhou, China, supervised by [Prof. Jinming Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jimmyxu). Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in automation from the [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/), Qingdao, China, in 2020. I was a visiting Ph.D. student with the [A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), supervised by [Prof. Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/). My research interests include distributed machine learning, large-scale optimization, security and privacy. **After graduation this year, I will join Huawei as a researcher and work on distributed training of large language models (LLM), with Distributed Parallel Computing Lab, Central Software Institute, 2012 Labs.**
